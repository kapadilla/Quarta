# Quarta

Quarta is a desktop application designed to empower ordinary Filipinos with financial literacy tools and resources. The name "Quarta," derived from the colloquial Filipino term for money, reflects the application's focus on financial education and management. Its mission is to bridge the gap between complex financial concepts and everyday individuals, making financial literacy accessible, engaging, and actionable.

Built using Java Swing, a part of Java's foundational libraries, Quarta leverages this robust framework to develop Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Java Swing's flexibility and cross-platform compatibility make it an excellent choice for creating a user-friendly and visually appealing application tailored to the needs of its users.
